Fladgejt
========

Fladgejt is a library for accomplishing common AIS tasks. It provides multiple
clients. The webui client uses Aisikl to access AIS through the WebUI interface.
The rest client uses the REST API to query the database directly. The demo
client does not communicate with AIS at all, and instead uses fake data.
